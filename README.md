Project Summary
![](dutch_baby_slice.png)
  This project explores sediment movement in a de-glacieted landscape. We are going to do this by exploring lateral moraine diffusion and its interactions with fluvial transport. Moraine diffusion will be influenced by thawing of an ice-rich core (represented as "bedrock lowering") and diffusion will be calculated using a depth dependent diffusion componenent. 

Project Steps:
* Generate topography
*   Must have down-valley slope, mirrored sin moraines parrallel to valley gradient
* Classify sub-surface land classes
* Diffusion
* Ice melting
* Channelized water flow
* Sediment transport
